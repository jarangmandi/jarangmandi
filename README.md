- 👋 Hi, I’m @jarangmandi
- 👀 I used to be a Software Engineer, and have worked on flight simulators, telecommunications systems and insurance systems. These days, I manage software engineers but still want to keep my hand in as it were. My primary interest remains flight simulation, however I'll dabble in anything if it enhances my experience of simulations or games, or helps me learn something new.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing really - keeping on top of developments in C# and C++ is just about it.
- 💞️ I'm not necessarily looking to collaborate on anything - my time is limited and I can't commit on any scale.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
